# ShareX Gate

## Introduction

ShareX Gate is the solution for having a self-hosted service for everything ShareX provides, like image, video and file hosting, text-snippet sharing and url shortening.
So basicly just a file server with some extra features, designed to be used with ShareX.

**ShareX uses these providers by default:**
- Image Sharing: Imagur
- Video Sharing: Streamable
- Text/Snippet Sharing: Pastebin
- URL Shortening: TinyURL

With ShareX Gate you can have all these services on your own server under your own domain.

**Why would you use this instead of the default providers?**
- You own your data
- You can use your own domain
- Your data isn´t distributed on different services

## (Planned) Features

- Upload images, videos or any other file from ShareX and serve them on your own domain
- Share text snippets and shorten URLs
- Store files directly on your host or an S3 bucket
- Preview images, videos and text directly in their own web interfaces
- View any other uploaded files which can´t be previewed in the default web interface
- Access raw files to embed them
- Use different (sub)domains for different actions or file-types
- Password protect files
- Add expiration or view limit with automatic deletion
- API for managing uploads
- Webhooks to integrate with other servcies
- Dashboard for easily managing all uploads
